# PALM - Password and Login Manager

#### Description
PALM is an application that allows for users to encrypt and store multiple types of information. Users can create an account with a username and password, login to that account, and manage their encrypted items. Items include logins, credentials such as identification or payment details, notes, and user customizable items. Each item can be updated or deleted and is saved to a file so that the user is able to access them after exiting the application. User files are encrypted and decrypted using the userâ€™s unique login so that they are the only ones able to access them.

#### How to Use
Run the main method in the PALM.java file to use a text based interface.

Run PALMGUI.java to utilize the graphical interface (WORK IN PROGRESS). 

A test user has been created with a username of "1" and a password of "123".
