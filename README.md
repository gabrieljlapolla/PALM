# PALM - Password and Login Manager

#### Description
PALM is an application that allows for users to encrypt and store multiple types of information.

Users can create an account with a username, password, and a TOTP MFA code, login to that account, and manage their encrypted items.

Items include logins, credentials such as identification or payment details, notes, and user customizable items. Each item can be updated or deleted and is saved to a file so that the user is able to access them after exiting the application.

User files are encrypted and decrypted using the userâ€™s password and a randomly generated salt.

#### How to Use
Run the main method in the palm.java file to use a text based interface.

palmgui.java launches the, currently non-functional, GUI.
